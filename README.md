&copy; Anand Gaurav (OpenALM)
<br>WordCard is a simple Android app that helps users improve their English vocabulary. 

### Code
This app uses native Android programming using Android Studio. 
#### About the app
This app 'WordCard' is useful in improving one's English vocabulary. It uses a static list of interesting Enginsh words and prompts the users to guess the meaning of the word before she can view the actual word definition/meaning.
One can use the *random* mode or *aphabetical* mode.
Also shows the users list of all the words and its definitions/meanings.

#### Technical overview of the app
* Uses basic Android programming.
* Tries to use Google's material design
* Target devices: Android Lollipop (5.0 and above)
* Makes use of RecycleView for listing out the words and their meanings/definitions. 
* Uses gradle to build

### Build using Visual studio Online
The app needs gradle to build and hence you would need Gradle task to build the application. Just use the Gradle build task/step and provide the following inputs:
* *Gradle Wrapper:* path to *gradlew.bat* file 
* *Task:* assemple
There would be certain issues in building this project as certain library dependencies cannot be resolved through the online maven or jcenter repos. You would need to download the Android support libraries through Android SDK Manager on the agent machine and point gradle to local repo.
